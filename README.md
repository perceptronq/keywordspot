high level roadmap (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)

- [] step 1 : build a model that works on american accent. <br>
  - [] step a: preprocess google speech commands. (conversion to MFCC then data augmentation, noise addition, pitch shifts etc) <br>
  - [] step b: model development(CRNNs or anything that shows promising results) <br>
  - [] step c: train on rvce gpu <br>
- [] step 2 : create your own indian accent dataset <br>
- [] step 3 : fine tune american accent model to work with indian accent dataset as well <br>
- [] step 4 : optimize, prune, quantize <br>
- [] step 5 : test and deploy <br>
